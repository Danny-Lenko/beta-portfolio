## My process

### Projects list

- BBQ school registration form
- Cars company survey form
- Seeds company landing page
- Blackjack game
- Roll dice game
- Minimalism blog

### What I learned

#### The Welcome Page

1) make a hidden attribute work

```css
[hidden] {display: none !important;}
```

#### Blackjack game

1) An easy way to toggle buttons passing arguments

```js
function toggleBtns(none, block) {
   none.style.display = "none";
   block.style.display = "block";
}
```

2) the .flow class to add space on top of children

```html
<div class="flow" style="flex-basis: 100%; --flow-space: 4rem">
</div>
```
```css
.flow > *:not(:first-child) {
  margin-top: var(--flow-space, 1rem);
}
```

#### Emoji Personality
1) an easy method to fetch value from an input field

```js
document.getElementById('textbox_id').value;
// For example
document.getElementById("searchTxt").value;
```



### Continued development

* aria (Accessible Rich Internet Applications);
* CSS custom properties (figure out all the advantages of setting variables);
* vh, vw values and their relevance;
* the clamp() property;
* CSS grid;
* JS - setting local variables;
* the minmax() property;
* the translateX(Y) property;

*Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
